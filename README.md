## Background
Here are some rabbitmq examples.

## Install
The code is written with python and Rabbitmq on CloudMQP (https://www.cloudamqp.com/).

## Usage
You can load a file into the interactive shell.<br />
python -i file.py<br />

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.

## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

To add in Markdown format, use this code:

```
